   This project was inspired by that awkward silence while sitting in class during Project Presentation Day.  While attending Eleven Fifty Academy in August of 2019, as a student, I noticed this within my own classroom.  After my graduation, EFA took me on as a Learning Assisstant and, after a couple months, I'm now part of the Learning Team for web development.

   In the classes that I've helped since coming on board with EFA, I've noticed this, "Who's going to go first?" question just linger there and, "Who's next?", ring that same bell.  So when I was asked to help my current class, now in June 2020, deploy their first API Projects to Google's Firebase, I decided to make a couple projects just to rehash my own personal understanding of what the Firebase deployment process was like again.  What resulted was a quick and small boardgame api project (https://searchboardgamesapi.web.app/) utilizing the Board Game Atlas API, and this project that touches a little with some minor APIs and focuses heavily on DOM manipulation, practicing with new frameworks, like Bulma and Ion Iconic, and more familiar ones like Bootstrap.

   My goal was to make this a simple design with colors that were similar to the bootcamp that I worked with.  I wanted it to have a splice of humor and fun that was clean and suitable for any enviornment.

   The secondary aspect to this project was simply for practice for myself.  With each step, I'm finding more and more to add but also noting that I have to put a limit to what is actually needed.  With even the smallest features within a project like this, it has taught me the complexity of even the simpliest step.
